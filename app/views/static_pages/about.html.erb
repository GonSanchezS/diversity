      <p class="main--paragraph text-large text-center">Diversity explores gender and race diversity in fast growing technology companies.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>How was data collected?</h4>
      <p>Data was collected manually from company team pages or Angellist, and verified once. If you are curious, you can find a link to each company's source in the <%= link_to 'raw data', data_path  %> section.</p>

      <h4>How were scores calculated?</h4>
      <p>First, it's important to understand how Gender Ratio, Race Ratio and the Diversity Score are calculated.</p>
      <p>
        <code>male employees / female employees = gender ratio</code><br />
        <code>caucasian employees / other race employees = race ratio</code><br />
        <code>gender ratio + race ratio = diversity score</code>
      </p>

      <p>Given that more equal numbers represent more diversity then the lower the score, the higher the company is in the rankings.</p>

      <p>As an example, Buffer has 49 male employees and 22 female employees. Of 71 employees, 56 are caucasian, 1 is black, 5 are hispanic, 5 are asian and 4 are Middle Eastern.</p>

      <p>That's a gender ratio of <code>49 / 22 = 2.22</code>, a race ratio of <code>56 / (1 + 5 + 5 + 4) = 3.73</code>. This means their score is <code>2.22 + 3.73 = 5.95</code>.</p>

      <p>It's far from accurate, but it's a start. If you want to collaborate on the score, <a href="https://twitter.com/gonsanchezs">let me know</a>.</p>


      <h4>Why was the project built?</h4>
      <p>I'm Argentinean, living in Paris and working for companies in the United States and Australia. Naturally, diveristy in tech is a relevant topic for me. </p>
      <p>As someone who works from home, I was curious about diversity in remote companies vs. non-remote companies. Essentially, are remote companies more diverse?</p>
      <p>That question led me to start collecting some data, and a few weeks later, an 8 hour day-flight and a bunch of coffee later, here we are.</p>
      <p>By the way, it turns out that remote companies are more diverse.</p>

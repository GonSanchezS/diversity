      <h4>Why did I built it?</h4>
      <p>I'm Argentinean, living in Paris, working for companies in the United States and Australia. Naturally, diveristy in technology is a relevant topic for me. </p>
      <p>Despite being catalogued as hispanic, I'm a white male who speaks almost native english, so I don't suffer racism outright.</p>
      <p>I was curious about diversity in remote teams, and  that led me through the rabbit whole.</p>
      <h4>Who am I?</h4>

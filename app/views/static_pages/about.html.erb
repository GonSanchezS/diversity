      <h4>How was data collected?</h4>
      <p>Data was collected manually from company team pages or Angellist, and verified once. If you are curious, you can find a link to each company's source in the <%= link_to 'raw data', data_path  %> section.</p>
      <h4>Why was the project built?</h4>
      <p>I'm Argentinean, living in Paris, working for companies in the United States and Australia. Naturally, diveristy in technology is a relevant topic for me. </p>
      <p>Despite being catalogued as hispanic, I'm a white male who speaks almost native english, so I don't suffer racism outright.</p>
      <p>I was curious about diversity in remote teams, and  that led me through the rabbit whole. I'm not sure if this is the optimal way to tackle the problem, and I don't care either. </p>
      <h4>Who built Diversity?</h4>

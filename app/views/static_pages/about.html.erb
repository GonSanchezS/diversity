      <h4>How was data collected?</h4>
      <p>Data was collected manually from company team pages or Angellist, and verified once. If you are curious, you can find a link to each company's source in the <%= link_to 'raw data', data_path  %> section.</p>
      <p>Everything was done with the best intentions, and the upmost respect for every single company in the rankings. If you wish to make a correction or remove your company, let me know.</p>

      <h4>How were scores calculated?</h4>
      <p>Gender and Race scores were calculated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Simpson_index">Simpson's Diversity Index</a>, which aims to quantify diversity in a single community sample.</p>

      <p>In practice, that's <code>D = 1 - (Œ£n(n-1)/N(N-1))</code>, where <code>n = number of individuals of each race/gender</code> in a company and <code>N = total number of individuals</code> in that same company.

      <p>The range is from 0 to 1, where high scores (close to 1) indicate high diversity and low scores (close to 0) indicate low diversity. To increase readability, the index was multiplied by 100 to get the score.</p>

      <p>The Diversity Score is simple the average of the Gender Score and the Race Score. Stupidly simple, because I don't know better.</p>

      <p>It's far from accurate, but it's a start. If you want to collaborate on the score, <a href="https://twitter.com/gonsanchezs">let me know</a>.</p>


      <h4>Why was the project built?</h4>
      <p>I'm Argentinean, living in Paris and working for companies in the United States and Australia. Naturally, diveristy in tech is a relevant topic for me. </p>
      <p>As someone who works from home, I was curious about diversity in remote companies vs. non-remote companies. Essentially, are remote companies more diverse?</p>
      <p>That question led me to start collecting some data, and a few weeks later, an 8 hour day-flight and a bunch of coffee later, here we are.</p>
      <p>By the way, it turns out that remote companies are exactly as diverse as non-remote companies.</p>
